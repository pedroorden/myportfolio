  title: "About me:"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>I am passionate about building complex knowledge to solve specific problems of people and their organizations.</strong> I found in programming a powerful development tool
    to complement the professional expertise of sociology, and an effective way to interact, operationally, with other dynamic actors of the digital world. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>I focus on computational social sciences and programming with R </strong> to provide answers to all those requirements that have to do with understanding people and their contexts through the massive analysis of information.
    My main skills are social data mining, natural language analysis and geo-computing.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    In my spare time I enjoy playing sports (running and swimming my favs), playing video games and producing music for independent audiovisual projects.    </p>
